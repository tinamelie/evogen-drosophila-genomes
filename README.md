# evogen-drosophila-genomes

Purpose: Document the steps taken with the evogen Drosophila genomes. The workflow combines external long-read assemblies with in-house short-read and RNA-seq data to produce a high-quality predicted gene models. Short reads are used to polish the assembly and support RNA-seq alignment.
